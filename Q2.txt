One dataset I recently discovered is the Steam Store Games dataset, which contains info on more than 35,000 games available on the Steam. The dataset includes information on game titles, release date, genres, ratings, and other game-related attributes.
I find this dataset particularly interesting because it can be used to analyze the trends and patterns in the gaming industry, as well as to identify the most popular game geners and the factors that contribute to a game's success. The data can also be used to build recomnendation systems for gamers based on their preferences. Moreover, with the ongoing growth of the gaming industry this dataset has the potential to be a valuable resource for researchers and game developers alike, allowing them to gain insights into the market and consumer behavior to make data-driven decisions.
