Here's a shell script that extracts the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields from the provided URL and saves them in a CSV file:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# URL and the output CSV file
url="https://amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt"
output_file="output.csv"

# Use curl to download the file and grep to extract the relevant fields
curl "$url" | grep -Eo '^[^;]+|;[^;]+$' | tr ';' ',' > "$output_file"

# explaination on how this script works:
1. define the URL and the output CSV file at the beginning of the script.
2. 'curl' command to download the contents of the URL.
3. 'grep' can be used with a regular expression to extract the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields. 
4. 'tr' command to replace semicolons with commas, which creates a CSV file.
5. The output is saved to the specified output file.
